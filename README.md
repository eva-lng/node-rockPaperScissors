# node-rockPaperScissors
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" using Node.js. It serves as a learning exercise to gain familiarity with Node.js and understand the underlying processes before diving into backend frameworks.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

## Features:
+ Players can make their move by choosing "rock," "paper," or "scissors" and see the outcome against the computer.
+ Game keeps track of player's and computer's scores using local storage 

## Lessons Learned:
The primary purpose of this project was to explore Node.js and gain a solid understanding of server-side development concepts. By implementing a basic game, I was able to get familiar with handling HTTP requests, routing, file system operations, and data manipulation.

Key learnings:
+ Gained familiarity with Node.js and its core modules such as http, fs, and url.
+ Understood the process of setting up a simple HTTP server and handling different routes.
+ Learned how to interact with the server using client-side JavaScrip.
